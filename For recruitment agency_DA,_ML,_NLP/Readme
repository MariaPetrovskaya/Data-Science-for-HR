#### Description of the project
- Introduction:
   - March 2024
   - The study focused on the impact of text features on job posting conversion rates. Various statistical and machine learning approaches were used. The best predictive capabilities were achieved using a pre-trained Bert and further data processing using CatBoost.
English version will be soon.
- Dataset:
- The recruiting agency provided full data of real IT job postings during previous year, including text descriptions and users activity.
- Business task
- For customer was important to predict will the response to the job posting be active

#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
