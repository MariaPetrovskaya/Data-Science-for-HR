#### Description of the project
   - March 2024
   - The study focused on the impact of text features on job posting conversion rates. Various statistical and machine learning approaches were used. The best predictive capabilities were achieved using a pre-trained Bert and further data processing using CatBoost.
.
#### Dataset:
- The recruiting agency provided full data of real IT job postings during previous year, including text descriptions and users activity.
#### Business task
- For customer was important to predict will the response to the job posting be active

#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
####  ML and NLP tools  
- Regression models (linear regression, decision trees, random forest)
- Gradient boosting (CatBoost, LightGBM)
- Transformers and BERT models for NLP
- Clustering (K-means)
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF)
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, stop words
- Model evaluation: MSE, R², MAE, accuracy 
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- For searching best hyperparameters used machine learning algorithm with pipeline, GridSearchCV.
- Machine learning models were trained and compared, the best model was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
